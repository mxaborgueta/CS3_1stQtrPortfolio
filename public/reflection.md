# Reflection Paper - BORGUETA, Miguel Xander A.
## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. Loop Control Structures - I had prior experience with these as I made a program that had nearly over 3000 lines that involved these types of structures. With the addition of exercise provided for the said lesson, I knew the lesson very well.
2. Variable Declaration - The lesson overall was simple to understand. And with the addition of practice exercises, the lesson became easy to understand.
3. Conditional Structures - As I mentioned before, my long program contained several hundreds of conditional statements. Also the experience prior to last year has helped me up to this point.
4. Declaring Functions - As mentioned once more, my long program consisted of several functions, seperating all of them and reducing search area. This experience alone helped me quickly understand the topic.
5. Arithmetic Operators - These were similar to C++ as well several other coding languages I used such as Rust. This alone helped me quickly understand said topic.
## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.
1. HTML Layout - Memorizing the syntax for HTML is difficult.
2. HTML Variable Declaration - This is confusing especially when involving interactions.
3. HTML Interactions - The syntax for simply adding a button or text box is difficult.
4. JavaScript Debugging - Difficult to analyze the code without understanding its true function.
5. JavaScript Syntax - JavaScript is still overall new to me.
## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
Run experiments as well as my own programs that use these topics. Having hands-on experience is usually easier for me as well as easier to debug as it is my own work.
## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
I think the two most effective exercises were the 2nd and 3rd graded exercise as they provided the majority of information about HTML and JavaScript combined. These include the interactions and conditional structures of HTML and JavaScript respectively. However, the two least effective tasks that helped me understand javascript and HTML were the 1st and 7th graded exercise. The 1st exercise being just a simple command that doesn't necessarily show anything much about the syntax of HTML. The 7th graded exercise, debugging, didn't make sense. Usually, when debugging code, you should understand each part of the syntax and not usually what's misused or misspelled. Additionally, when debugging code, the original person who composed said code should be the one debugging it as they know how it works inside and out.
